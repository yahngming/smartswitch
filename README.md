# SmartSwitch

* Minimal interface. No web frontend. A simple HTTP request triggers the relay.
* Browser support. Accessible through the switch's LAN IP address.
* Tasker support. This provides infinite possibilities to automate the switch.
* Pebble support. The sample app.js is a CloudPebble watchapp demonstration.
